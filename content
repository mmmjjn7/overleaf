\section{Introduction}
CCD (Colony Collapse Disorder) refers to the disappearance of bee colony in some states of the United States and some countries in Europe and Australia since 2006. 
\section{Background}
About 50\% to 90\% of commercial bee colonies in the United States suffer from colony collapse (CCD) in 2007. 
\subsection{potential reasons}
\subsubsection{Infectious diseases and parasites}
The most suspected pathogens include Israel acute paralysis virus (IAPV)\citep{maori2009iapv}


\subsubsection{Chemical drugs with bee venom}
The anti-pathogenic drugs used in the hive and the pesticides in the environment have potential bee venom, which may be related to CCD. 
\subsection{ Literature Review}
Although there is no direct way to judge the real cause of the CCD phenomenon, monitoring the \par

Rahman Tashakkori\citep{tashakkori2017honeybee} and several scientists proposed to observe the bee activity by implementing an automatic image processing system to construct a relatively inexpensive module to monitor the flight path of bees and the number of bee trips, including collecting weather factors to analyse the travel of bees. 
\section{Research Methodology }
Determining the theme of a project is a prerequisite for the success of the project. CCD is the background of the whole project. 


\subsection{Image Processing}
The content of the acquired data set is mainly divided into three categories, the first type \par

\subsection{Training picture feature extraction and selection}
Feature extraction refers to obtaining various metrics or attributes that are useful for classification from the object itself. \par
In theory, the characteristics of an individual are unique because there are no two identical individuals. 
\section{Ethics and professional considerations200}
For the Ethics and professional considerations\citep{d} 
Also, the protection of animal rights\citep{ghasemi2009ethical} 
\section{Risk consideration }

The second is about getting the data set, the source of the training photos are all from the network resources.
\section{Project evaluation}
The function of this project is mainly to realise the detection and recognition of the queen bee using image processing and machine learning.
\section{Planning}
The chart below illustrates the processing time of this graduation project.
